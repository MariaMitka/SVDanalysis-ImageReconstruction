# SVDanalysis-ImageReconstruction
This project uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for image analysis and reconstruction. It reads images from a folder, performs SVD, and reconstructs them with varying numbers of singular values (k). It also calculates reconstruction errors and compares memory usage between the original and reconstructed images.
